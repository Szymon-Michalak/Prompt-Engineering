### Usage Notes:
- **TL/DR**: 
  - **Purpose**: The TL/DR section provides a quick, high-level summary of the content. It should be concise and cover the main takeaway or concept in 1-2 sentences.
  - **Application**: Craft this summary by focusing on the most critical point(s) in your content. Place this section immediately after the "Sources & Resources" details.
  
- **Styling Enhancements**:
  - **Bold**: Use bold text to emphasize important concepts, terms, and conclusions within your content. This makes it easier for readers to identify key points quickly. Example: **Singleton Pattern**.
  - **Code Formatting**: Use inline code formatting (i.e., `code`) for any code-related elements like methods, functions, classes, or keywords. This helps distinguish code from regular text and enhances clarity. Example: `sharedInstance`.
  - **Headings**: If your content lacks clear structure, introduce or refine section headings. This not only improves readability but also makes the content easier to navigate. Use Markdown headings (e.g., `## Section Title`) for this purpose.

- **Organize Content**:
  - **Purpose**: Structured content is easier to read and understand. If your existing content is disorganized, consider breaking it into sections with clear headings.
  - **Application**: Review your content and identify logical sections or topics. Label these sections with appropriate headings to guide the reader through the material.

- **In Bullets**:
  - **Purpose**: The "In Bullets" section serves to summarize the key points from your content. It provides a quick reference or recap of the most important takeaways.
  - **Application**: After reviewing the content, distill the main points into 2-3 bullet points. These should capture the essence of the content, making it easy for readers to recall the most critical information.
  - **Placement**: Include this section at the end of your content, just before the "Usage Notes" section.

- **Content Preservation**:
  - **Objective**: This template is designed to enhance existing content without altering its core message or structure. Focus on improving readability and accessibility rather than modifying the content itself.
  - **Non-Intrusive Enhancements**: The suggested enhancements, such as bolding and code formatting, should be applied in a way that complements the original content. Avoid overuse of formatting to maintain a clean, professional appearance.
