   - **Tags:** Use relevant tags to help users find similar problems or topics. Tags can include related algorithms, data structures, or specific topics like "Dynamic Programming" or "Sorting".

2. **Problem Statement:**
   - **Clarity:** The problem statement should be clear and concise, providing all necessary information without overwhelming the reader. Avoid unnecessary jargon and focus on the core challenge.
   - **Context:** Providing context can help users understand why solving this problem is important or useful, particularly in real-world applications or common interview scenarios.

3. **Constraints:**
   - **Specificity:** Clearly define the constraints, including limits on input size, value ranges, and any performance expectations (like time complexity). This ensures that the problem is well-scoped and solvable within the given constraints.
   - **Relevance:** Make sure the constraints are relevant to the problem and aligned with typical scenarios users might encounter, especially in technical interviews.

4. **Input and Output Format:**
   - **Precision:** Describe the expected input and output formats with precision, using examples if necessary to illustrate. This prevents misunderstandings about how the solution should handle various inputs.
   - **Edge Cases:** While detailed edge cases are reserved for the solution, consider mentioning any input or output that might seem ambiguous or unusual.

5. **Example Cases:**
   - **Illustrative:** Choose example cases that illustrate the problem well, including both straightforward and slightly complex scenarios. Each example should help clarify the problem and show how the solution is expected to behave.
   - **Explanations:** Provide step-by-step explanations for each example to ensure users understand how the output is derived. This is especially useful for more complex problems.

6. **Additional Notes:**
   - **Hints and Tips:** Offer subtle hints or tips that can guide the problem-solving process without giving away the solution. This might include common pitfalls, things to watch out for, or advice on how to approach the problem.
